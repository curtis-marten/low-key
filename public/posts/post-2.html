        <h1>Style Matters</h1>

        <p>
            This is my second post in my static webpage blog. I'm committing to documenting more of
            my project and experiments here, regardless of size.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want this mini blog to have a reasonable style and a simple workflow. Since this site
            is a simple static site hosted with firebase, I don't want to hastle with installing
            server side programs. I will eventually link my separate VPS hosted site for that.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine simple style format with date, title, paragraphs, and image content</li>
            <li>
                Find an html linter or formatter to automatically format and keep consistent line
                length
            </li>
            <li>Link the titles of each post with the link text on the main blog page</li>
            <li>Extras: Dark mode, colors, backgrounds, fonts and other style spice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Progress</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Code Formatting: I found a Javascript and HTML formatter called Prettier. I
                installed the VS Code extension and enabled "Format On Save" in the current
                workspace. This really makes my code more readable, especially with these longer
                lines of text. Having to handle splitting lines at the correct column is such a
                waste of brain power.
            </li>
            <li>
                Style: Need to figure out how to add date and link titles. Also the spacing is too
                tight
            </li>
        </ul>
